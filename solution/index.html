                        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world, and was one of the first
                        domesticated
                        animals. Chicken is a major worldwide source of meat and eggs for human consumption. It is
                        prepared as
                        food in a wide variety of ways, varying by region and culture. The prevalence of chickens is due
                        to
                        almost the entire chicken being edible, and the ease of raising them.

                        Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was
                        one of the
                        most common meats available in the Middle Ages. It was eaten over most of the
                        Eastern
                        hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were
                        eaten. It
                        was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of
                        chicken and
                        fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.
                        The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl
                        first raised
                        thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.

                        Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was
                        one of the
                        most common meats available in the Middle Ages.For thousands of years, a number of
                        different
                        kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere, including capons,
                        pullets,
                        and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of
                        chicken and
                        fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.

                        In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was
                        "sought by the
                        rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish." Chicken consumption in the U.S.
                        increased
                        during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken
                        overtook
                        that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy
                        (mad cow
                        disease).

                        This is a list of notable beef dishes and foods, whereby beef is used as a primary ingredient.
                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle. Beef can be harvested from
                        cows, bulls, heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the
                        world.

                        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat
                        production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[1] In absolute
                        numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three
                        largest consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009, Argentines consumed the most beef at
                        64.6 kg per person; people in the U.S. ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.[2]

                        Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump
                        steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak...). Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef
                        jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or
                        used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage.

                        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice
                        (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ,
                        neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its
                        presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari
                        (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

                        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown
                        rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel,
                        yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often
                        served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon
                        (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

                        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of
                        thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.originates in a
                        Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice
                        for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from
                        spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of
                        sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally
                        means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi,
                        no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall
                        dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty,
                        notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of
                        narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and
                        preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly
                        increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually
                        abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries
                        it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed
                        into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
